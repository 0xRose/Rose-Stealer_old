**We will keep you updated and remove specific warnings if the problems are solved.**

#### 10/08/2023 - I'll be working more on actual fixes now, because I add more stuff with issues than i actually fix.

#### 02/08/2023 - Working on an improved version of Rose-Injector & Rose-RAT but I have like 10 really difficult projects running at the same time, so expect the next bigger update to take some more time.
#### 16/07/2023 - All official Rose discord servers have been closed because of way too unethical decisions made by our community.
#### 10/07/2023 - Following functions are not available at the moment: `getadmin | disable windows defender` and `obf src`. Our team is already working hard on solving these problems.
#### 11/06/2023 - Almost everything is working, however, to compile you *must disable real time protection for windows defender*.
#### Encoutered an error while building? Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ts9RTFYvyt) or [Telegram group](https://t.me/+7MDF550ZlLVhYjUy)! You will need to send us both .log files which are created while building.

**Our professional team spent months of work on this project and we hope you will enjoy your journey through the world of cybersecurity.**

[Rose-RAT](https://github.com/DamagingRose/Rose-RAT) is a remote access trojan with lots of features which allows the attacker to control a victims desktop with our application through different commands.

[Knight-RAT](https://github.com/DamagingRose/Rose-Injector/blob/main/components/source/knight_rat.py) is the improved version of Rose-RAT with commands being executed over discord & more features at all.
