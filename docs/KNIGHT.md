# Knight Rat: A Beginner's Guide

## Introduction
Have you ever wondered about Knight Rat and how it operates? Look no further; this guide is here to help you understand the basics of this Python-based remote access trojan.

## What is Knight Rat?
Knight Rat is a powerful remote access trojan designed in Python, allowing users to gain unauthorized access to a computer and execute various commands. The process involves running a file, executing a predefined set of actions, and establishing a connection through a Discord bot to a remote server, providing full control over the targeted computer.

## How Does it Work?
In a nutshell, the victim runs the Knight Rat file, which connects to a Discord bot. The bot then attempts to send a ping to a specified user ID in a designated channel, using a custom-generated rat UID with the ping. By employing the "!clients" command, you can retrieve all connected IDs. Subsequently, you gain control over the targeted computer, with a comprehensive set of commands accessible through "!help." When you want to execute a specific command on a victim you can do it like this ---> **example**: `!screenshot 871623`

## Preparing the Bot
Before diving into the setup, you must create a bot application on [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Navigate to the bot tab, enabling all privileged gateway intents. Refer to [this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1180179668498927618/1180981629313880144/image.png?ex=657f65da&is=656cf0da&hm=46c8ba00046c6f165d78b53a7f48480809ab7b3def429cd8dc6fb67256606f44&) for guidance. Once done, invite the bot to your server with administrator permissions, using [this link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1180179668498927618/1180982394652737566/image.png?ex=657f6690&is=656cf190&hm=d1ab6a46c1080fffb966aaeda4d09c1ae2942480663fed29369d002098ccb4aa&).

## Setup
When building a stub with Rose and enabling the Knight Rat feature, fill in the required fields. Reset the bot token, copy your user account ID and the channel ID for command operations. Find your user account ID [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/discord-id#:~:text=To%20find%20a%20user's%20Discord,sidebar%20and%20select%20Copy%20ID). Choose a command prefix like "!" or ".", or leave it empty. Congratulations, you've successfully set up Knight Rat!

### Important Note
Knight Rat is a basic rat designed for .py usage, created for fun with no intention of further updates or improvements. It comes with limited features and a straightforward interface. Do not expect enhancements or fixes, as the author has no plans for future updates.
