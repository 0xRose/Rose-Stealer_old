# Because people constantly ask me what knight rat is and how it works. Well yeah, here is your guide dummies.
                    ----
# What is knight rat?
## Knight rat is a remote access trojan that is written in python and is used to gain access to a computer and do whatever you want with it.
## Breakdown: someone runs file ---> does whatever you selected for the stealer ---> connects through a discord bot to your server ---> you can do whatever you want with the computer.
                    ----
# How does it work?
## Quick: Victim runs file ---> connects to discord bot ---> tries to send ping to specified user id in specified channel ---> send custom generated rat uid with ping (you can also get all ids with the command !clients) ---> you can now do whatever you want with the computer.
## View all commands with !help and if you dont understand a command or it doesnt work, try using !help `[command]`, but it may just be broken.
                    ----
# Preparing the bot
## There are a few fields and stuff to do. You first need to create a bot application on https://discord.com/developers/applications. After that done, you need to head over to the bot tab. There you need to enable all privileged gateway intents. Enable these: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1180179668498927618/1180981629313880144/image.png?ex=657f65da&is=656cf0da&hm=46c8ba00046c6f165d78b53a7f48480809ab7b3def429cd8dc6fb67256606f44&
## Now you need to invite the bot to your server. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1180179668498927618/1180982394652737566/image.png?ex=657f6690&is=656cf190&hm=d1ab6a46c1080fffb966aaeda4d09c1ae2942480663fed29369d002098ccb4aa& You can do it here. At the bottom you can see the invite link. Open it in a new tab and select the server you want. Please make sure u invite it with administrator permissions as a bot. Now you need to get the bots token.
                    ----
# Setup
## When you build a stub with rose and enable the feature Knight-RAT, you may see a few fields to fill in. So what do you need to do now?
## Just go back to the bot options and click on reset token. This is the first info you will need. Now you should copy your own user account id and the channel id where you wish to operate with commands. https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/discord-id#:~:text=To%20find%20a%20user's%20Discord,sidebar%20and%20select%20Copy%20ID. Now you need to select a command prefix such as ! or . You can also leave this empty I think, never tried.
## Congrulations! You've just set up knight rat! Now you can build your stub and use it.
                    ----
## Don't forget this is a skiddy rat I wrote for fun, only for .py usage when I had absolutely no experience, so do not expect crazy features, or a super cool interface. It's just a rat that works, and that's it. I'm not going to update it, so don't ask me to do it. Some stuff doesnt work, some doesnt. I don't care. I'm not going to update it. I'm not going to fix it. I'm not going to add features. I'm not going to do anything. I'm not going to make it better. I'm not going to make it worse.
                    ----
# And if you're to stupid to understand this guide or ask for any help, you'll get immediately banned. I'm not going to help you. I'm not going to explain you any shit.
