WELCOME
=======

Welcome to UPX !

UPX is a free, secure, portable, extendable, high-performance
executable packer for several executable formats.


INTRODUCTION
============

UPX is an advanced executable file compressor. UPX will typically
reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus
reducing disk space, network load times, download times and
other distribution and storage costs.

Programs and libraries compressed by UPX are completely self-contained
and run exactly as before, with no runtime or memory penalty for most
of the supported formats.

UPX supports a number of different executable formats, including
Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables.

UPX is free software distributed under the term of the GNU General
Public License. Full source code is available.

UPX may be distributed and used freely, even with commercial applications.
See the UPX License Agreements for details.


SECURITY CONTEXT
================

IMPORTANT NOTE: UPX inherits the security context of any files it handles.

This means that packing, unpacking, or even testing or listing a file requires
the same security considerations as actually executing the file.

Use UPX on trusted files only!


SHORT DOCUMENTATION
===================

'upx program.exe' will compress a program or DLL. For best compression
results try 'upx --best program.exe' or 'upx --brute program.exe'.

Please see the file UPX.DOC for the full documentation. The files
NEWS and BUGS also contain various tidbits of information.


THE FUTURE
==========

  - Stay up-to-date with ongoing OS and executable format changes

  - RISC-V 64 for Linux

  - ARM64 for Windows (help wanted)

  - We will *NOT* add any sort of protection and/or encryption.
    This only gives people a false feeling of security because
    all "protectors" can be broken by definition.

  - Fix all remaining bugs - please report any issues
